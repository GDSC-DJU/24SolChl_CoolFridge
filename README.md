## üñå Introduction
With the increase in single-person households these days, more people are cooking for themselves. Consequently, there's been a rise in the amount of food waste generated. **Recognizing that poor management of food inventory is a major cause of food waste**, our team developed an app called "CoolFridge". 

The CoolFridge app offers a widget feature that allows users to check their **achievement levels** for food inventory management, a **receipt and food recognition** feature for easy registration, a **recording page** for monitoring the condition of food, and an **AI recipe** feature for efficiently processing ingredients. This allows **efficient inventory management**  and enables users to consume ingredients using recipes recommended by AI. Through these functions, we can **reduce food waste** and take a step towards creating a more sustainable planet

## üåè UN SDGs Goals & Target
SDG 12 Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.

We chose the 12th SDG because it aligns with our goal of reducing the increasing environmental pollution.
> Target 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.
**We exert influence on individuals. As a result, many individuals become a majority and can contribute to society**. This aligns with our goals, so we chose it as a means to achieve them.

## üéØ Future Plans

**Food waste occurs for various reasons, including excessive food preparation, improper food storage, and purchasing more food than necessary.** Our app currently focuses on solving the food waste problem through its '**inventory management feature**.' In addition to this, we support effective inventory management through other functionalities.

In the future, we aim to focus on resolving issues related to **excessive food preparation** and **purchasing more food than necessary**.

**Our ultimate goal is to significantly reduce food waste.** To accomplish this, we will provide user-friendly UI/UX and practical features, making our application easily accessible to many people. We endeavor to foster a user-friendly structure and convenient features that can solve real problems, with the aim of **encouraging individual actions to become the majority. This collective contribution to reducing environmental pollution is the core value and objective of our project.**
