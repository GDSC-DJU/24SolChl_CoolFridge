## 🖌 Introduction
With the increase in single-person households these days, more people are cooking for themselves. Consequently, there's been a rise in the amount of food waste generated. **Recognizing that poor management of food inventory is a major cause of food waste**, our team developed an app called "CoolFridge". 

The CoolFridge app provides features for managing food inventory and recommending recipes based on the ingredients currently available. This allows **efficient inventory management**  and enables users to consume ingredients using recipes recommended by AI. Through these functions, we can **reduce food waste** and take a step towards creating a more sustainable planet

## 🔧 How to run our app service
**Since the API key has been kept private, you need to run the APK file to utilize all features of the app**
  
You need to download the file [apk-release.apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ny4mjwseVSKyJd8nzc71CldNkpnngqM/view?usp=sharing).

To execute the file, you can "Run" or "Start Debugging" from the **main.dart** file.

## 🌏 UN SDGs Goals & Target
SDG 12 Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.

We chose the 12th SDG because it aligns with our goal of reducing the increasing environmental pollution.
> Target 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.
**We exert influence on individuals. As a result, many individuals become a majority and can contribute to society**. This aligns with our goals, so we chose it as a means to achieve them.

## 🎯 Future Plans
**Food waste is generated due to various reasons including excessive purchase, improper storage, misunderstanding of expiration dates, and leftovers**. Our application currently **focuses on solving the 'misunderstanding of expiration dates' issue through the 'inventory management function'.** It also assists with effective inventory management through other features.

In the future, we plan to add 'automatic recording of expired products' and 'AI recommended storage methods' features to **address the issues of excessive purchase and improper storage more thoroughly.**

**Our ultimate goal is to significantly reduce food waste.** To accomplish this, we will provide user-friendly UI/UX and practical features, making our application easily accessible to many people. We endeavor to foster a user-friendly structure and convenient features that can solve real problems, with the aim of **encouraging individual actions to become the majority. This collective contribution to reducing environmental pollution is the core value and objective of our project.**
